# My dotfiles

These are the dotfiles on my machines that I intend to reuse.
Bloated files generated by bloated software are not considered dotfiles just because they are stored inside `~/.config`.
Rather, files are added to git chirurgically, like `git add <path/to/dotfile>`.
To add any changes made to files that are already being tracked, use `git add -u .`.

## Git branches

There are multiple branches, because each machine I use may have a slightly different configuration.
The name of the branch is the hostname of that particular machine.

# Setup

What comes next is a list of the basic software found on my machines.

The selection criteria is inspired by [the suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/):
- FOSS (obviously)
- Simplicity
- Speed
- Ease of use

The list is subject to change. I am especially looking for better alternatives
to Sway, Waybar and pulseaudio. Write me for suggestions.
